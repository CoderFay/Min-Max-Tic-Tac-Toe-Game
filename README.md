# Adversarial Search: Games

## Overview

This project notebook delves into **Adversarial Search**, a pivotal technique in Artificial Intelligence (AI) used primarily in game theory. Adversarial search helps in determining the optimal moves in two-player competitive games. This notebook examines various strategies and algorithms that enable AI agents to make decisions in such competitive settings.

## Key Concepts

- **Adversarial Search**: A technique in AI for modeling decision-making in competitive scenarios. It is commonly applied in turn-based games with two opposing players taking alternate turns.

- **Minimax Algorithm**: A fundamental adversarial search algorithm that aims to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. In a two-player game, one player attempts to maximize the score while the other strives to minimize it.

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm. It reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree, accelerating the decision-making process.

## Contents

- **Introduction**: An overview of adversarial search and its significance in AI.

- **Game Implementations**: Implementation details of various two-player games, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, utilizing adversarial search algorithms.
